## Meyraki - Work Sample
Through my internship with luxury-skincare start-up Meyraki, I was tasked in creating a market analysis report, collecting compeititor data through web scraping and developing actionable insights to aid market postion strategies aand product pricing. 
### Meyraki Competitor Analysis Project

Project Overview: This competitor analysis examines Meyraki's positioning against five competitors (Juara, Tata Harper, Vintner’s Daughter, Sensai, and Tatcha) across market share, pricing, and target audience segments. The goal is to provide strategic insights for Meyraki to strengthen its competitive edge in the luxury skincare market.

**Key Insights:**

Market Share & Positioning: Vintner’s Daughter leads with a 24% share, followed by Tatcha (19%) and Tata Harper (20%). Meyraki should explore targeting eco-conscious consumers as Tata Harper has excelled with sustainability-driven marketing.
Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): Competitors rely on culturally rooted ingredients (Juara), advanced technology (Sensai), or minimalistic luxury (Vintner’s Daughter), allowing them to capture specific market segments.
Pricing Strategy: Meyraki can experiment with mid-tier luxury pricing, similar to Juara, to reach a broader consumer base without diluting its premium brand identity.

**Visualisations:**
The following visualisations summarise the competitor analysis:

**Recommendations:**
*Expand Sustainability Messaging:* Highlighting sustainable practices will align Meyraki with market trends and attract younger, eco-conscious buyers.

*Targeting Unisex Products:* Introducing a gender-neutral skincare line could open up a growing male skincare market.

*Accessible Luxury:* Offering more affordable products (while maintaining luxury status) can help Meyraki tap into the pricing strategy used effectively by Juara and Sensai.

To determine a suitable price point for ultra-luxury skincare products, Meyraki should consider the average prices of similar products, which range from £60 to £210 or $55 to $210. The company must assess whether its products justify these prices based on their unique formulation, packaging, and brand positioning. A price range between £150 to £300 could reflect exclusivity and premium quality. Given Meyraki's niche product composition, Juara, although not in the ultra-luxury market, is the closest competitor. Ultimately, the price should align with the perceived value of the products and the target market's willingness to pay.
