## Meyraki - Work Sample
Through my internship with luxury-skincare start-up Meyraki, I was tasked in creating a market analysis report, collecting compeititor data through web scraping and developing actionable insights to aid market postion strategies aand product pricing. 
### Meyraki Competitor Analysis Project

Project Overview: This competitor analysis examines Meyraki's positioning against five competitors (Juara, Tata Harper, Vintner’s Daughter, Sensai, and Tatcha) across market share, pricing, and target audience segments. The goal is to provide strategic insights for Meyraki to strengthen its competitive edge in the luxury skincare market.

Key Insights:

Market Share & Positioning: Vintner’s Daughter leads with a 24% share, followed by Tatcha (19%) and Tata Harper (20%). Meyraki should explore targeting eco-conscious consumers as Tata Harper has excelled with sustainability-driven marketing.
Unique Selling Propositions (USPs): Competitors rely on culturally rooted ingredients (Juara), advanced technology (Sensai), or minimalistic luxury (Vintner’s Daughter), allowing them to capture specific market segments.
Pricing Strategy: Meyraki can experiment with mid-tier luxury pricing, similar to Juara, to reach a broader consumer base without diluting its premium brand identity.

Visualisations:
The following visualisations summarise the competitor analysis:

Recommendations:

Expand Sustainability Messaging: Highlighting sustainable practices will align Meyraki with market trends and attract younger, eco-conscious buyers.
Targeting Unisex Products: Introducing a gender-neutral skincare line could open up a growing male skincare market.
Accessible Luxury: Offering more affordable products (while maintaining luxury status) can help Meyraki tap into the pricing strategy used effectively by Juara and Sensai.
To suggest a price point for ultra-luxury skincare products, we can consider the average prices of
similar products in the market provided in Table 15:
• Tata Harper Cleanser: £66.40
• Tata Harper Serum: £154.29
• Juara: $55.18
• Tatcha: $66.30
• Sensai Cleanser: £60.00
• Sensai Essence: £210.18
• Vintner's Daughter: $210.75
Considering these prices, it's evident that ultra-luxury skincare products typically fall within a
higher price range. Meyraki must determine whether its prospective products are valued at these
price points. If so, Meyraki should aim for a price point that reflects exclusivity and premium
quality, where given by the range of prices in Table 15, a price point between £150 to £300 (or its
equivalent in dollars) could be suitable, depending on factors such as unique formulation,
packaging, and brand positioning. Given Meyraki’s niche product composition & USP, Juara is its
closest and most comparable competitor, though Juara does not lie in the ultra-luxury market,
hence the suggested price point may be an attractive proposition. Ultimately, the price should
align with the perceived value of the products and the target market's willingness to pay for luxury
skincare
